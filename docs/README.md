# This is a super simple test documentation file for moosica

Moosica is a simple desktop app to convert a list of songs from a spotify playlist into an easy to download list of links.

Moosica and it's creators do not endorse piracy, but ultimately cannot control you actions.

Moosica is built to work with the [exportify](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/exportify) project.

Because of this, Moosica can also provide analytics about the kind of music you listen to (on spotify).
